# Systems programming projects in ARMv8/MOS 6502

Assignements and projects for an ARMv8 and MOS 6502 (NES) part of a university course on systems programming

## Automation scripts
- `./build.sh`: Custom bash script to clean, build and run the assembly code
- `.bashrc`: Custom bashrc to add the `build.sh` script to the path and change the base bash prompt

## Main projects
- Prime and palindrome validation in ARMv8 assembly [(devoir2)](https://github.com/simlal/systems-programming-projects/tree/main/assignements/assign2)

- Memory access and manipulation in ARMv8 assembly [(devoir3)](https://github.com/simlal/systems-programming-projects/tree/main/assignements/assign3)

## Exercices
- lab1: Intro to ARMv8 assembly programming with sorted pythagore validation
- lab2: Bitshift operations and multiplication in ARMv8 assembly
- lab3: Array creation and travelsal in ARMv8 assembly
- lab4: Structured programming in ARMv8 assembly
